# The Road Won't Rise to Meet You

A small game about how hard it is all the time.


## Experimental Gameplay

This game was created for the [Experimental Gameplay Project July 2011](http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/2011/07/disintegrate-in-july/) challenge: DISINTEGRATE.

However, it is not an official submission because we took the whole month (not 7 days) to make the game and there were two of us working on it. But the theme was interesting and who needs a reason to make games?

## Goals

Our goals were to:

1. Create a very small, simple game, in a small amount of time for the Experimental gameplay competition.

2. Hint at a deeper idea underlying the simple gameplay and art.

3. Have at least one fun mechanic that encourages some amount of replay beyond a single attempt.

4. Have at least 5 levels created.
